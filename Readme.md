# Stealth Swap
An intent-based swap protocol with Dutch auction mechanics on Solana

A production-ready DeFi protocol that enables users to express swap intents while solvers compete through Dutch auctions to provide optimal execution. Built with Rust and Anchor framework, demonstrating advanced Solana development patterns.

## Features
Core Protocol
Intent-Based Trading: Users express swap intentions without immediate execution

Dutch Auction Mechanics: Price discovery through linear decay over time

Solver Competition: First-come-first-served claiming with economic incentives

Atomic Settlement: All-or-nothing transaction execution with bond protection

MEV Protection: Reduced front-running through time-delayed price discovery

## Technical Highlights
PDA Architecture: Secure program-derived addresses for escrow and auction management

Bond System: Anti-griefing mechanism with solver collateral and slashing

Cross-Program Invocations: Safe token transfers with proper authority delegation

Event Emission: Complete off-chain indexing support for solver bots

Rent Optimization: Automatic escrow cleanup and rent recovery

##  Technology Stack
Language: Rust

Framework: Anchor 0.31

Blockchain: Solana

Testing: TypeScript with Mocha/Chai

Token Standard: SPL Token Program

Prerequisites
```bash

## Technical Documentation
### Key Design Decisions
Intent-Based Architecture: Separates user expression from execution timing

Dutch Auctions: Provides fair price discovery through time-based decay

Solver Competition: Creates MEV-positive environment with proper incentives

Atomic Settlement: Ensures transaction safety through Solana's execution model

### Rust/Solana Patterns Demonstrated
Advanced PDA design and seed management

Cross-program invocation (CPI) safety

Event-driven architecture for off-chain integration

Token program interaction patterns

Rent optimization and account lifecycle management
